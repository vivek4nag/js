    // Lexical scoping (also known as static scoping) refers to how variable access is determined based on the physical structure of the code when it is written, not at runtime. In other words, the location where a function is declared (lexically) determines the scope in which it can access variables. Inner functions can access variables from their outer scope because of this.
    // niche wale function me outer function ke andar defined variable (username) will be accesseble by all the inner function. But that variable can't be accessed from outside
    function outer(){
        let username = "Vivek"
        function inner(){
            let secret  = "olalalaa" // this secret has scope only within this inner function. can't be accesed even by sibling function inner2
            console.log("inner: ", username);
        }

        function inner2(){
            console.log("inner2 :", username);
            console.log(secret);
            
        }

<script>
    // script to understand closure
    // an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) functionâ€™s variables, even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are created every time a function is defined inside another function, and the inner function accesses variables from its parent scope.
    // Closure allows a function to "remember" and access its lexical scope, even when that function is executed outside its lexical scope. The function that is returned from an outer function will retain access to the variables that were in scope at the time the outer function was declared, even after the outer function has completed its execution.


    // when we are returning  displayName we are not simply returning that function by refernce but also the memomry remembers it's parent function & variables bcz of lexical scoping
    function makeFunc() {
        const name = "Mozilla";
        function displayName() {
            console.log(name);
        }
        return displayName;
    }

    const myFunc = makeFunc();
    myFunc()
    // Even after makeFunc() finishes execution, the inner function displayName() still has access to the name variable because of the closure. This happens because JavaScript functions retain access to the variables in the scope where they were defined, even after the outer function has returned. This is lexical scoping.
    // So, when myFunc = makeFunc() is executed, the function displayName is returned, but it "remembers" the variable name from makeFunc's scope, due to the closure. When myFunc() is called, it still has access to name, which is why "Mozilla" is printed.


    // now khudka example of closure using button
    // document.getElementById("orange").onclick = function(){
    //     document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'orange'
    // }
    // document.getElementById("green").onclick = function(){
    //     document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'green'
    // }

    function clickHandler(color){
        // document.body.style.backgroundColor = '${color}'
         return function(){
            document.body.style.backgroundColor = '${color}'
        }
    }

    document.getElementById('orange').onclick = clickHandler
